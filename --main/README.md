# Project Title (Inferred: Smart Manufacturing Vision Analysis)

This project appears to involve computer vision tasks, potentially related to smart manufacturing, using a trained model, video/image processing, and AI analysis.

## Overview

*(Please add a brief description of the project's main goal and functionality here.)*

The project seems to utilize:
- A Python script (`main.py`) as the main execution point.
- A pre-trained model (`best.pt`), possibly for object detection or classification.
- A Jupyter Notebook (`Smart ManufacturingGemini.ipynb`) for experimentation or analysis, potentially involving Google Gemini.
- Video input (`vid4.mp4`) for processing.
- Image cropping functionality (output in `crop_2025-04-03/`).

## Features

*(List the key features or capabilities of the project.)*
- Video processing
- Object detection/analysis using `best.pt`
- Image cropping
- Potential integration with Google Gemini for reporting or further analysis

## Requirements

*(List any prerequisites or dependencies needed to run the project. E.g., Python version, specific libraries like PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.)*
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- ... (Add other dependencies based on `main.py` and the notebook)

## Usage

*(Provide instructions on how to set up and run the project.)*

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file might be needed)*
3.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py 
    ```
    *(Add any necessary command-line arguments if applicable)*
